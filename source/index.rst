Dear Learner,

This Content Module includes 2 video lectures addressing fundamental principles, thermodynamics, mechanical work and efficiency of Brayton cycle machines

In the light of the pedagogical methodology, "student-centered education" requesting personal commitment and active participation by the learner, the module is built up around a set of voluntaryÂ (like watch, read, ..) and compulsory (multiple choice, open-ended, calculation, ...) activities in which the learner can self-determine the progress.

The learner is recommended to go through, in sequential order, the different activities throughout the module, starting with "Activity 1".
