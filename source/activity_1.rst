A1 | Introduction
=================

Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
=================================

At the end of the Module, the learner will be able to

Knowledge:
----------

1. Understand a Brayton cycle
2. Understand the design process for determining the station temperatures and pressures
3. Understand the design process for determining the power and efficiency

Skills:
-------

1. Calculate work and efficiencies for a Brayton cycle

Responsibility and Autonomy:
----------------------------

Not applicable for this module

Assesment
=========

The learners are expected to:

* Make self-tests by answering the assessment questions (compulsory as well as non-compulsory) proposed
* Go through all the self-evaluations in this learning unit and answer these correctly before progressing to the next learning unit in the lesson
* Learners registered at a partner university are furthermore expected to participate in a live online, instructor-led discussion

Abstract, Uniqueness and Societal Relevance
===========================================

Abstract & Fundamentals:
------------------------

This Content Module includes 2 video lectures addressing fundamental principles, thermodynamics, mechanical work and efficiency of Brayton cycle machines

Uniqueness:
-----------

Although this is a general module with relevance to thermodynamics and aerodynamics it is unique in applications to aircraft turbine engines and power turbines.

Societal Relevance:
-------------------

The module emphasizes the application of thermodynamics and aerodynamics knowledge to mechanical engineering design. Good design processes can lead to efficient operation, which reduces environmental impact and lower cost.

Evaluation and Grading Criteria
===============================

Self-learners:
--------------

Pass/fail on the automatically corrected questions, self-reflections on the questions posed, peer discussions on these

Learners registered at a partner university:
--------------------------------------------

* Pass/fail on the automatically corrected questions, self-reflections on the questions posed, peer discussions on these
* A pass on the Automatically Corrected Questions gives automatically 50% of the participation grade.
* Manual evaluation by the instructor related to the answers given in the live online discussion. This corresponds to the other 50% of the participation grade.

Study/Certificate Level, Expected Learning Hours
================================================

The module has identified the following attributes:

* European Qualification Framework (EQF) Level: 7
* Sri Lanka Qualification Framework (SLQF): 7-10
* BTL (Details): 1-3
* ELH: 4
* SMCTS: 0.15

Prerequisites
=============

* BSc in Mechanical Engineering or similar knowledge.
* Knowledge of undergraduate physics, thermodynamics and differential equations (linear and 2nd order).

Learning Guidelines
===================

For the most efficient and appropriate learning process, the following method is suggested:

* Study the content of the videos, reflect upon the explanations given and the consequences these might have for the design
* Study the indicated reading material
* Answer the recommended self-study assessment questions
* Answer the recommended automatically corrected questions
* Identify your own personal items for the live online discussion.

Learners seeking academic credits and/or certificates
=====================================================

Automatically generated "Certificate of completion":
----------------------------------------------------

At the end of the module the learner has the possibility to obtain a certificate identifying that the person has been able to answer all the automatically corrected questions.

Academic credits:
-----------------

This material is part of a course in a curriculum offered at Duke University, USA, under the name "ME490".
Any learner who seeks academic credits at Duke needs to officially register for the course. This can be done through contact with one of the teachers.
